## TASK: Recreate the Google Search page in HTML/CSS


Create an index and style page that replicates the
Google Search page as closely as possible. (The page
does not need to function.)
Use Figma to prototype the page first and use it to
obtain CSS data â€“ eg. Position, width, height, text
colour, background colour border sizes and border
radius.
You should include:
Proper html <div> structure & CSS styling
Input field
Icons sized and placed correctly
